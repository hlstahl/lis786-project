# About 

The FSW Writing Center Resource Library is home to handouts, guides, and tutorials by FSW Writing Center's staff. This library is a constant work-in-progress, as we regularly update our materials and create new guides that support updates to course content. 

You can meet with Writing Center staff in-person at our Charlotte, Collier, and Lee campuses, or online from anywhere in the world (*with a decent internet connection*).
