## In Text Citations in APA

In-text citations in APA format can look a couple of different ways, but they’re pretty simple. When they come at the end of the sentence, they include the author’s last name, the publication date, and the page number (for direct quotes). Page numbers are not required for paraphrases, but they are encouraged.  

>*“They might look like this” (Smith, 2019, p. 23).*

You can also include the author’s name within the sentence. In that case, the publication date comes immediately after the author’s name and the page number will go at the end of the sentence in parentheses.

>*As Smith (2019) stated, “They might look like this” (p. 23).*

If your source doesn’t have an author, cite the article title in quotation marks and in title case. 

>*That might look something like this (“Citing Sources,” 2020, p. 2).*

If the author is an organization – use that. 

>*Here's one last example (The Foundation for Properly Citing Sources, 2018, p. 14).* 

Make sure that every in-text citation matches the first part of its corresponding entry on the References page. For example, if you have an entry that looks like this:
 
![Example of an APA cited source with handing indent](/lis786-project/assets/images/hanging indent.png)
 
The in-text citation would look like this: 

>An Arduino board makes building a robot a little bit easier **(“How to Build a Robot,” 2021).** 
 
Or like this: 

>According to the article, **“How to Build a Robot,”** you can find most of what you need to build your own robot "at your local electronics hobby shop, or several online retailers." 
 
But it wouldn’t look like this: 

>According to an article from **WikiHow,** you can teach yourself computer programming by building a robot.
