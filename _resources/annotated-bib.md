An **annotated bibliography** is list of sources, each followed by an annotation---a brief paragraph summarizing and evaluating the source. Sources should be cited using the format your professor requests (such as MLA or APA). Typically, the annotation includes a summary, an evaluation of the text, and a reflection on its applicability to your own research.

An annotated bibliography can help you organize your thoughts about the sources you've gathered for a research project. It can also help you decide which sources to keep and which ones you don't need.
