In MLA, the in-text citation can look a couple different ways. It can come at the end of the sentence after a quote or can be part of the sentence itself. Either way, it tells the reader where to find the source for the quote on your Works Cited page which gives more detailed information about the source. 

An in-text citation usually has the author’s last name and the page number of where you found the quote, all placed in parentheses at the end of the sentence, followed by a period, like this: 

>Recent research shows that cats can make a good alternative therapy pet for those who are allergic to dogs (Smith 32). 

If the source doesn’t have an author listed, use the title of the article or book -- whatever is listed first in the works cited entry -- like this: 

>The key to a good paper airplane is to find a balance between "lift, weight, and center of mass" (*Paper Airplanes for Dummies* 76). 

Electronic sources often don’t have page numbers, in which case you just skip that part, like this: 

>The myth of the 'haunted' Victorian home stems partly from an early 20th Century desire to "criticize the bloatedness of the period" (“Why are Victorian Houses Haunted?”). 

Make sure that every in-text citation matches the first part of its corresponding entry on the Works Cited page. For example, if you have an entry that looks like this:

![MLA formatted works cited entry](/lis786-project/assets/images/Black cats.png)
 
The in-text citation would look like this: 

>Black cats have unfairly been associated with bad luck when they can actually be quite affectionate companions (“The History of Black Cats”). 

Or: 

>According to the article, “The History of Black Cats,” it's believed that "The superstition surrounding black cats dates back to ancient times." 
 
But it wouldn’t look like this: 

>According to an article from Garlic City Kitty Rescue, "were linked to witches and were often persecuted alongside accused witches." 

Similarly, if you had this source on your Works Cited page:

![MLA formatted works cited entry](/lis786-project/assets/images/Vocal chords.png)

The in-text citation would look like this: 

>If you have hoarseness or voice changes that last more than two weeks, it could be a sign that your vocal chords have been damaged (Childs). 

Or: 

>According to Lesley Childs, an otolaryngologist at the UT Southwestern Medical Center, "for every 60 minutes of voice use, you need 10 minutes of voice rest." 

But it wouldn’t look like this: 

>According to the article “3 Signs Your Vocal Chords May be Damaged,” it is not normal to experience throat or neck pain when using your voice.
